# Mastermind Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Mastermind Game project!  
This project is a learning exercise in building and deploying a game on the Agoric blockchain.  
The game allows users to play Mastermind, where they guess a secret code generated by the contract, using the Mersenne Twister package.  
It provides feedback on each guess and updates its state based on the userâ€™s attempts.

## Project Components

1. **Smart Contract**: The core component deployed on the Agoric blockchain that manages game logic and state.
2. **UI**: User Interface that interacts with the smart contract to allow users to play the game.

## Features

- **Create New Game**: Users can create a new game by submitting an offer.
- **Guess Submission**: Users can submit guesses, where each guess is checked against the secret code.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: For each guess, feedback is provided:
  - **Black Color**: Represents correct values in the correct position.
  - **Red Color**: Represents correct values in the wrong position.
- **Game Phases**: The game phase can be either:
  - **Active**: The game is in progress, and users can continue making guesses.
  - **Completed**: The user has won the game by guessing the correct code.
  - **Failed**: The user has lost the game by exhausting all attempts without guessing the correct code.

## Getting Started

Detailed instructions on setting up the environment, including a video walkthrough, are available at the [Your First Agoric Dapp](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/getting-started/) tutorial.  
If you already have the environment set up (i.e., the correct versions of Node.js, Yarn, Docker, and the Keplr wallet), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Lopes/mastermind.git
   cd mastermind
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   _Downloading all the required dependencies may take several minutes. The UI depends on the React framework, and the contract depends on the Agoric framework. The packages in this project also include development dependencies for testing, code formatting, and static analysis._

3. **Start Local Agoric Blockchain**:

   ```bash
   cd contract
   yarn start:docker
   ```

4. **Check Logs**:

   ```bash
   cd contract
   yarn docker:logs
   ```

   Once the logs resemble the following output, stop the logs by pressing `Ctrl+C`:

   demo-agd-1  | 2023-12-27T04:08:08.407Z block-manager: block 1005 commit
   ```

5. **Start the Smart Contract**:

   ```bash
   cd contract
   yarn start:contract
   ```

6. **Start the UI**:

   ```bash
   cd ui
   yarn dev
   ```

   Use the link provided in the output to load the smart contract UI in your browser.

## Testing

To run the unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```
